The Legend of the Hero of Capstone
Made using Vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, and Canvas

This was my first attempt at making a game, and with the help of some tutorials to get a lot of the bigger world items working I was able to focus primarily on the battle system and mechanics. Currently the player is able to traverse the starter town, talk to npcs, and and leave the town and enter the goblin keep for a battle. There are 2 cutscenes that play, as well as an event that occurs if you try to enter the castle. I've created several skills and animations.
